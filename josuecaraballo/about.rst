I  love machine learning, big data, distributed systems, and other computer science topics. 

I\'m a programmer, gamer (board and video game), comic-book reader and avid movie goer.

  1. Gorn
  2. Arizona Sunshine
- Switch online: `SW-8222-4266-8618`_
  3. Super Mario Maker 2

Here\'s `my GitHub`_, I like to put stuff up on git.
